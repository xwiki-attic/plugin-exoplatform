Plugin for interacting with the exoplatform container when running as a portlet inside it.

It has been retired since it hasn't been maintained for years.

This extension uses the plugin technology which has been deprecated and is now replaced by Components.
If someone is interested in improving this extension, we recommend rewriting it as components.
